    "p1": "As Vancouver continues its journey toward becoming one of the world’s greenest cities, energy-efficient building practices are no longer optional—they’re essential. One of the most effective and forward-thinking approaches to sustainable architecture is Passive House design, a standard that drastically reduces energy consumption while improving comfort and air quality. At Forma, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of green development, and our latest projects embrace Passive House principles to set a new standard for urban living.",
    "h2": "Why It Matters for Vancouver’s Future",
    "p2": "Passive House (or Passivhaus, as it originated in Germany) is a rigorous building standard that prioritizes energy efficiency, airtight construction, superior insulation, and heat recovery ventilation to create homes that require little to no active heating or cooling. These buildings consume up to 90% less energy than traditional structures while maintaining a consistent and comfortable indoor climate year-round.",
    "h3": "Leading the Charge in Sustainable Development",
    "p3": "At Forma, sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. Our latest projects, The Arbor, incorporate Passive House standards to deliver homes and commercial spaces that are not only future-proof but also comfortable and affordable. As Vancouver’s development landscape evolves, we’re committed to staying ahead of the curve, building homes that are aligned with the city’s green vision. Want to learn more? Contact us today to discover how our energy-efficient developments are shaping the future of urban living."

These homes aren’t just built for today; they’re crafted for a greener tomorrow.",
    "h2": "Design With a Conscience",
    "p2": "Gone are the days when sustainable living meant compromising on comfort or style. Our latest project proves that eco-conscious architecture can be as elegant as it is efficient. From solar-ready rooftops to energy-smart appliances, every detail is designed to reduce environmental impact without sacrificing sophistication.",
